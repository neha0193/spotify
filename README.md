## ✅ What We Did
- Planned the site structure → sketched layout & decided required pages.  
- Installed dependencies: **Tailwind CSS**, **React Icons**, **React Toastify**, and **React Router**.  
- Organized `assets` data from the source.  
- Created a `pages` folder with different file nameed on different tabs in site with setup of boilerplate `rafce` components.  
- Set up **BrowserRouter** in `main.jsx` and defined all routes in `App.jsx`.  
- Built a **responsive Navbar component** inside `components/` and included it in `App.jsx`.  
- Created the **Hero Section** → added heading text, hero image, and Google Fonts.  
- Created a **context file** for accessing `assets.jsx` data and added global values (e.g., currency, delivery fee).  
- Built the **Latest Products Section**:  
  - Used `useContext` to pull in product data.  
  - Added a reusable **Title** component.  
  - Built a **ProductItem** component and mapped over product data.  
- Built the **Best Seller Products Section** → displayed products where `isBestSeller === true`.  
- build policies and newsletter box displayed a email input for newsletter 
- build footer section
